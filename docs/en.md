# FEMA Disasters

Follow the **disaster declarations** of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for your
county from Gladys: hurricanes, floods, fires, winter storms, tornadoes… When a disaster hits, the
President (major disaster, emergency) or FEMA (fire management assistance) declares it for a list of
counties, and opens aid programs there: **Individual Assistance** (help for households, to apply for
on DisasterAssistance.gov), **Public Assistance** (for local governments) and **Hazard Mitigation**.

The integration reads these decisions from [OpenFEMA](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/api), the
open data of FEMA, for the county of your house or the counties you choose. No account, no API key.

Declarations are administrative decisions, often made days after the event: this is not a safety alert
system. In an emergency, follow the instructions of your local authorities and the National Weather
Service. Not affiliated with FEMA. This product uses the FEMA OpenFEMA API, but is not endorsed by
FEMA.

## What you get

- One **device per county**: disaster declared (yes / no), incident type and declaration date of the
  latest declaration, Individual Assistance, Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation open (yes / no),
  and the number of declarations over 12 months.
- A **dashboard widget**: one row per county, its active declarations, programs, registration deadline
  and links to the FEMA page of each disaster and to DisasterAssistance.gov.
- Two **scene triggers**: a new declaration for your county, and Individual Assistance opened (with
  the registration deadline).
- A **scene action** that reads the active declarations as one sentence, to send by message or have
  it read aloud.

## Requirements

- Gladys Assistant 5.3 or later.
- Internet access from the Gladys host (the integration reads `www.fema.gov`, and `geo.fcc.gov` to find
  the county of your house).
- A house in the United States (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
  territories): its location in Gladys (Settings → Houses), or county FIPS codes typed in the
  configuration.

## Configuration

### Settings

| Setting                            | What it does                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| County FIPS codes                  | Up to 8 county codes of 5 digits, separated by commas. Empty: the county of your house.    |
| Refresh interval                   | 30 minutes, 1 hour (by default), 3 or 6 hours.                                             |
| Language of the names and messages | Names of the features (at their creation) and texts sent to the scenes. French by default. |

Save, then open the **Discover** tab of the integration and create the device of each county. The
**Show the current declarations** button of the configuration answers right away: a quick way to check
the settings.

### Finding your county

Leave the field empty: the integration sends the location of your house, rounded to three decimals
(about 100 m), to the [FCC Area API](https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/) once, and gets its county. It asks
again only when the location of the house changes.

To follow other counties (family, a second home), type their **FIPS codes**: 2 digits for the state,
then 3 for the county. Examples: `12086` Miami-Dade County, Florida; `06037` Los Angeles County,
California; `22071` Orleans Parish, Louisiana. The Census Bureau publishes the
[list of the codes](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html). A code it does
not know is ignored and shown in the status of the configuration.

### Active declaration

A declaration covers your county when FEMA designates it, or the whole state ("Statewide"). Tribal
declarations, made for tribal lands, are not counted. A declaration is **active** when it is not closed
out and:

- it was made less than 30 days ago;
- or its incident period is still open (an incident without an end date counts for one year at most,
  30 days for a fire management declaration, which never gets one);
- or its Individual Assistance registration is still open (until the last filing date).

"Individual Assistance" is on while the registration of an active declaration is open (60 days after the declaration while FEMA gives no deadline). "Public
Assistance" and "Hazard Mitigation" are on when an active declaration includes them.

## Device

| Feature                   | Type    | Values                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disaster declared         | Binary  | 1 when a declaration is active                          |
| Incident type             | Text    | Latest declaration, e.g. "Hurricane · Hurricane Isaias" |
| Declaration date          | Text    | Its date and number, e.g. "10/27/2026 (DR-4955)"        |
| Individual Assistance     | Binary  | 1 while registration is open                            |
| Public Assistance         | Binary  | 1 when an active declaration includes it                |
| Hazard Mitigation         | Binary  | 1 when an active declaration includes it                |
| Declarations in 12 months | Counter | Declarations made over the last 365 days                |

The device is named "FEMA · county, state": rename it in Gladys as you like. The values are sent only
when they change, and again every 12 hours.

## Dashboard widget

Add the **FEMA declarations** widget to a dashboard. It shows the number of active declarations, then
one row per county with a red "Declared" or green "None" badge. Tap a row for the details: number, type
and date of each declaration, incident period, programs, registration deadline, and the links. The
footer gives the time of the last reading and a link to the FEMA declarations page (it can be hidden
in the widget settings).

## Scene triggers

**FEMA: new declaration for my county.** A declaration made in the last 90 days appears for a followed
county. Filters: the county (its device), and the declaration types (major disaster, emergency, fire
management). Variables: `county_name`, `declaration_id` (DR-4955-FL), `declaration_type_name`,
`incident_type` (as FEMA writes it, in English), `incident_type_name`, `title`, `declaration_date`,
`individual_assistance` (true when registration is open), `summary` (one sentence) and `url`.

**FEMA: Individual Assistance opened.** Residents of a followed county can apply for FEMA assistance:
with a new declaration, or later, when FEMA amends a declaration to add the county to the program.
Filter: the county. Variables: `county_name`, `declaration_id`, `incident_type_name`, `title`,
`deadline` (last day to register, when FEMA gives it), `summary`, `url` and `registration_url`.

The declarations already listed when a county is first followed fire nothing: they are not news. A
restart of the integration fires nothing either.

## Scene action

**FEMA: read the declarations** reads OpenFEMA again if the last reading is older than the refresh
interval, and returns:

- `text`: the active declarations of each county, in one sentence;
- `active_count`: the number of active declarations;
- `assistance_open`: true when Individual Assistance registration is open in a followed county.

## Scene examples

- **Tell the family**: on "Individual Assistance opened", send `{{triggerEvent.data.summary}}` and the
  link `{{triggerEvent.data.registration_url}}` by message.
- **Weekly reminder**: every Monday, run "read the declarations", then send its text if
  `assistance_open` is true.
- **New declaration**: on a major disaster declared for your county, send `{{triggerEvent.data.summary}}`
  and `{{triggerEvent.data.url}}`.

## Data sources, terms and quotas

- Declarations: OpenFEMA dataset "Disaster Declarations Summaries" (v2), public data of the US
  government, read without an account. This product uses the FEMA OpenFEMA API, but is not endorsed by
  FEMA. The Federal Government or FEMA cannot vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data
  after the data have been retrieved from the Agency's website(s). See the
  [OpenFEMA terms and conditions](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions).
- County of the house: [FCC Area API](https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/), public, without an account.
- County names and codes: US Census Bureau, 2020 FIPS codes (the vintage FEMA uses), shipped with the
  integration.
- Quotas: OpenFEMA publishes none for this use. The integration sends one request per county per refresh
  interval (every hour by default), and one request to the FCC when the house moves.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No county"**: give your house a location in Gladys (Settings → Houses), or type county FIPS codes.
- **"No US county at the location of your house"**: the house is outside the United States (or its location is in the sea): type the FIPS codes of the counties to follow.
- **The house moved to another county**: a new device is offered in the Discover tab; delete the device of the old county, which no longer gets values.
- **"Ignored (not a county FIPS code)"**: check the code in the Census list (5 digits, leading zero
  included or not: `6037` and `06037` both mean Los Angeles County).
- **"OpenFEMA does not answer"**: the service is down or unreachable from the Gladys host. The last
  values stay; the integration tries again at every refresh and says so in its logs once.
- **No trigger after a change of settings**: expected, the declarations already there are not news.
- **The names of the features are in the wrong language**: they are set when the device is created.
  Change the language, delete the device, then create it again from the Discover tab.
- Logs: the integration page of Gladys, Logs tab. Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for a line per reading.

## Limits

- Declarations are decisions taken after an event, sometimes weeks later: they say where federal aid
  goes, not where danger is. For warnings, see the National Weather Service and your local authorities.
- Disaster Recovery Centers are not listed: FEMA publishes them on its own site and the FEMA app.
- Incident types are translated; declaration titles, county names and FEMA numbers stay in English.
- Tested against the real OpenFEMA service on November 12, 2026 (an active county, a calm county, invalid
  codes); not yet in a real Gladys instance: feedback welcome on the forum.
